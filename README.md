# JIL - HTML5 Game UI

![Logo](./logo.png)

**UI Framework for HTML5 Games**:
 * Autoscale and centering
 * Vector positioning (`pivot`, `anchor`, `position`, `scale`, `rotation`)
 * Fast HTML5/CSS3 (Use CSS3 transform & Virtual dom)
 * Tween integration (Provide an easy way to write animation)
 * Layer system make it easy to organize UI
 * Engine agnostic (Work with HTML canvas and dont interfer with 2D/3D Engine):
   - Babylon.js
   - Pixi
   - Phaser
   - Three.js
   - ...

> This is still a project in **early development**
>
> I plan later, to make a small editor to design scene UI and export them in `*.json`
